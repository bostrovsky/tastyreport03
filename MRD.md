**Success Metrics:**  
- 100% sync reliability (no data loss/duplication)
- >90% automated test coverage
- <1% critical bug rate post-launch
- <2 min average sync time for typical user
- User satisfaction (NPS > 8)

**Target Timeline:**  
- MVP: 8 weeks  
- Full Feature Set: 12-14 weeks

**Testing Philosophy:**  
- TDD at every step: write tests before/with code
- Automated unit, integration, and E2E tests for all features
- Manual testing only for UI/UX edge cases or where automation is impractical
- All code must meet minimum coverage and pass all tests before merging
